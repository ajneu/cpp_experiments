= Controlled ctor dtor

Some interesting constructor/destructor examples.

* `std::shared_ptr<std::unique_ptr<T>>`
+
Like a globally tracked resource that you can delete anywhere! +
This should behave like shared_ptr, but one whose content can be globally destructed from anywhere. +
Anybody still having access, needs to check if it has been destructed. +
If nobody has access anymore, it needs to destruct itself.
+
[source,cpp]
----
// The usage is thus:
if (inner_unique_ptr_valid(sig_p)) { // check if still valid
   (**sig_p).member();               // access
}
// The two steps above would need to be mutex-protected in a multithreaded environment

// To globally destruct:
if (sig_p) {                         // check that shared_ptr is actually holding a pointer (in this case a unique_ptr)
   (*sig_p).reset();                 // reset the unique_ptr
}

* `std::experimental::optional<T>`
+
Construct and destruct anywhere, and work on the stack (not heap!)

* `PlaceStackConstr<T>`
+
Own example of constructing and destructing anywhere, and working on the stack (not heap).
